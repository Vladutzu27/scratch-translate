# scratch-translate
A word translator made in scratch using the Google translate API included in srcratch. Made last year
I WILL UPDATE THE GAME WITH BETTER UI AND MORE LANGUAGES SOON.
AT THE MOMENT YOU CAN TEST THE ONE-SIZE FONT BY USING ”A” AND TYPING SOMETHING IN, OR TRANSLATING FROM ROMANIAN TO ENGLISH USING R. 
YOU CAN TRANSLATE FROM ENGLISH INTO ROMANIAN USING ”E”
